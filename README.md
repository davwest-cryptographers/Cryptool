# Cryptool
> For our CSA project, we chose to make a Cryptography tool, designed with easy to follow instructions for secret spies of all ages. Cryptool read .txt files (notepad files) and is able to take a chosen shift number (as the program is built off the Caesar Shift cipher), and shift all of your characters that many down the line. It doesn't only encrypt, it will deccrypt aswell. Follow the same steps as before, but this time it will move all your characters back the direction they came from. Whether you are a secret KGB spy or an officeworker tired of having your coworkers reading your classified documents over your shoulder, Cryptool will protect you.

## Install Instructions
